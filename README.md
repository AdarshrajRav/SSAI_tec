# MyApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.2.

## Development server

Pull down the repository using `git clone https://github.com/AdarshrajRav/SSAI_tec.git` in our terminal. 

Navigate into the directory and `npm install`.

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## The page

When you load into the page you should see this: ![Screen Shot 2022-06-23 at 1 17 49 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98137713/175392749-fc9d510a-06b9-49c5-a87f-b228695a071b.png)

The data currently loaded on is hard coded into `./src/app/app.components.ts` on line 18. This data does get deleted when clicking on the delete button but will reappear when you refresh the page. 

You can add more data onto the page by clicking on the `New Entry` button on the top right. A component will then appear towards the top of the page.

You will also be able to sort the data on the page using the `Sort` button on the top right. This component will also appear towards the top of the page.

You can sort by Date, Temperature, and Wind Speed. You can also click the `sort by [...]` button to switch the order of the sort. 

Within each data-card you will see the date, time, temperature, and wind speed. You also see clickable text to delete and edit the card. Once you click edit the info will change to inputs to allow for users to change the data.

Inputing any bad info in any area that allows for user input will result in red text popping up under the incorrect input.
